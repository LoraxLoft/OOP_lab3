Algo1 : building convex linear shell for the given dots with Andrew & Jarvis algorythm. Algorithm complexity N^2, coded in jarvis.h

Algo2 : building convex linear shell for the given dots with Graham algorythm. Algorithm complexity Nlog(N), coded in graham.h

Graphics provided using SFML library.

P.S.
main2.cpp : there was also intention to imply building of Voronoi diagram with Fortunes method, but now there are aclually just two sliding parabolas yet.
